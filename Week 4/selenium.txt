1) What is Selenium? What are the different Selenium components? Explain about Selenium Webdriver.
Selenium is an automation testing tool used to test web-based applications. Selenium is not a single tool but a suite of tools.
 There are four components of Selenium – Selenium IDE, RC, WebDriver, and Grid. Last two being the most famous one.

2) How does Selenium communicate with the Web browsers?
Data Communication - To communicate between server and client (browser), selenium web driver uses JSON. JSON Wire Protocol is a REST API that transfers the information between HTTP servers.
 Each Browser Driver has its own HTTP server

3.What are the locators available  to find an element using Selenium?
1.By CSS ID: find_element_by_id
2.By CSS class name: find_element_by_class_name
3.By name attribute: find_element_by_name
4.By DOM structure or xpath: find_element_by_xpath
5.By link text: find_element_by_link_text
6.By partial link text: find_element_by_partial_link_text
7.By HTML tag name: find_element_by_tag_name

4. Why ID is preferable than X-Path?
ID is considered as unique key so there cannot be more than 1 elements for same ID while Xpath is created using relative path/position of elements, so there can be cases when we can get 2 or more elements for same Xpath.

5.How to select value in dropdown?
selectByVisibleText(String args) ...
selectByIndex(String args)
This method takes the index of the option to select in the dropdown. ...
Syntax - Select s = new Select(driver.findElement(By.id("<< id exp>>"))); s.selectByIndex(1);
selectByValue(String args)

6) What is the difference between Absolute Path and Relative Path?
In simple words, an absolute path refers to the same location in a file system relative to the root directory, whereas a relative path points to a specific location in a file system relative to the current directory you are working on.

It returns in boolean value
Returns true if it is checked
Return false if it is unchecked

8)Difference between System.setProperty and WebDriverManager
WebDriverManager
webdrivermanager automates the browser setup in the selenium code
By default,it downloads the latest version of the browser binary for the appropirate platform
we have to add the dependencyfor webdrivermanagerin case the code belongs to maven environment

system.setproperty
It is used to configure the browser driver path
The selenium client library communicates with the chromedriver via the JSON wire protocol

9) Write the syntax for preceding and following x-paths.
//input[text()='jack']//following-sibling::input
//input[text()='jack']//preceeding-sibling::input

10) How to get an attribute value using Selenium WebDriver?
